# Product Mission (Lite)

ChiefSupport is a local-first AI meal planning assistant that plans 1.5 weeks of meals, optimizes a single shopping trip, and reduces waste by using inventory- and expiry-aware planning.

It serves a single user who wants calorie-aware plans, minimal grocery runs, and privacy. Unlike typical meal planners, ChiefSupport uses an agentic planner that sequences meals around expiry dates, suggests substitutions, and dynamically replans as reality changes.
